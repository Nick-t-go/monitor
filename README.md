A starting project using Ionic for recording measurments taken for aquariums, greenhouses, and aquaponic systems.

## Porject Specifics

Currently uses Firebase as backend to store test results and user information.
Uses d3 to display summary of test results.
Follows Ionic's sidemenu template.

## ToDo

1) Allow users to create tests and test intervals. 
2) Allow users to store more than just water tests.
3) Add more visulations for monitoring test results.
4) Alert user of negative test results and supply possible causes and fixes
5) Look into automization of test taking and correcting.
